# Assessment of greenhouse gas emissions in a portfolio

Climate change has emerged as the biggest environmental challenge of our time, posing significant risks and opportunities for the financial industry. Investors who are aligning their investments with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, implementing net zero investment strategies or enhance their financial risk management processes due to the transition to a low-carbon economy need to measure, manage and report the emissions of their investment portfolios, referred to *financed emissions*.

[LSEG Climate data](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/financial-data/company-data/climate-datasets) provides granular companiy reported climate data which is aligned with the latest disclosure and regulatory standards, sophisticated analytics and innovative estimated emissions models covering approximately 90% of the global market cap. Our hierarchical, multi-model approach to estimating emissions improves data accuracy, reduces risk of underestimating emissions, and solves for clients the data availability challenge. The transparency of sources and methodologies supports PCAF quality score assessment at a company level. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a financial sector initiative establishing an international standard for calculating GHG emissions from loans and investments.

LSEG Estimated Emissions methodology is available here (add once published, otherwise delete sentence).

A company’s carbon footprint is a key metric for quantifying its contribution to rising temperatures, as well as its vulnerability in case of a rapid decarbonization trajectory. There are three complementary categories of emissions:

* Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources by the reporting company. 
* Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the consumption of electricity, heat, steam and cooling.
* Scope 3: Indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in the company’s value chain or its products life cycle
	* Upstream emissions: constitute emissions from processes in the value chain that contribute to a company’s products or services (e.g. purchase of goods and services, upstream freight, employee commute, etc.)
	* Downstream emissions: constitute emissions from the activities of customers using a company’s products and services, which includes financed emissions

Depending on your overall objective, there are several ways to assess “financed emissions”, each of them serving its own purpose:

* Financed emissions (in tCO2eq) represents the total GHG emissions “owned” by portfolio through its investee firms. It can be used as an “impact” metric, to understand the overall climate impact of investments, and set an absolute baseline for GHG mitigation actions;
* Financed emissions intensity (in tCO2eq/$M invested) is the financed emissions as described above divided by the investment volume. It can be useful to compare different investment policies, portfolios, or to track year on year progress;
* Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI, in tCO2eq/$M revenues) is the average of carbon intensity (by revenues) of investee firms, weighted by portfolio exposure. WACI is used to compare different portfolios, it helps understand exposure to emissions-intensive companies and has been endorsed by TCFD.

Furthermore, one of the primary objectives of GHG emissions accounting must be to create transparency for stakeholders. Therefore, being able to assess the quality of the data used to perform carbon footprinting, and how it translates into the overall quality of the assessed financed emissions, is a critical step on the decarbonization journey.

In this article, we’re using PCAF (2022). [The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part A: Financed Emissions. Second Edition](https://ghgprotocol.org/global-ghg-accounting-and-reporting-standard-financial-industry) principles.

The portfolio used in this illustration is the FTSE All World universe.

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
